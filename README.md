# Real-Time Image Classification with Mojo

This project demonstrates real-time image classification using Mojo, a high-performance programming language for AI/ML. The system captures images from a webcam, preprocesses them, and performs inference using a pre-trained ResNet model.

## Features
- Real-time image capture and classification.
- Optimized inference using Mojo's performance capabilities.
- Easy-to-use interface with OpenCV.

## Setup
1. Install Mojo and required dependencies.
2. Download the pre-trained model weights.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   mojo run image_classification.mojo
